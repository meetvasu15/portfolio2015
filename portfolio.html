				<h1>Business Analyst</h1>
				<h3>Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Texas</h3>
				<h4>June 2014 - Present</h4>
		<p>My day to day job as a Business Analyst is to gather requirements from businesses groups, create functional and technical requirements for developers and then validate development work. I often create context level diagrams to identify interfaces and high level processes associated with the projects. 
</p><p>
One of my projects involve investigating data across systems for inconsistencies and then fix the issues in the interfaces of systems which requires writing code to compare the data sets extracted from multiple systems. I leverage my knowledge of tools like Power Query and minimize the amount of code I have to write. I perform technical design and review code written by developers to ensure good quality.

				<h3>Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Texas</h3>
				<h4>May 2013 - December 2013</h4>
		<p> During my internship at Freescale Semiconductor I proposed and implemented web solutions for identifying issues at various stages of Freescale's chip fabrication process. I developed front end and back end of web applications used by more than a thousand employees at Freescale.
			</p>
			<p>One other goal was to redesign the existing websites to make them more intuitive for the users and summarize data using Google chart Visualization for project managers. To achieve a good response time I optimized existing web services by tweaking SQL queries and rewriting some algorithms to read data from multiple databases.</p>

			<!--Software Developer, HCL experience-->
			<h1>Software Engineer</h1>
				<h3>HCL Technologies, New Delhi</h3>
					<h4>June 2011 - August 2012</h4>
		<p> I started my software engineering career at HCL Technologies. I learnt and mastered languages like Java, JavaScript and SQL by implementing them in industrial size website development projects. At HCL, we were of a team of about ten front end developers that were learning and implementing the then new technologies like HTML5 & CSS3, making everyday life challenging and exciting. Loved that job!</p><p> I also worked on back end of some applications and gained skills in optimizing retrieval of large sets of data.  I felt the need of formal education in software engineering/web development so decided to pursue my Masters in Computer Sciences at Arizona State University.

		  Vasu is an excellent resource. He joined us as a Fresher with no prior programming experience. He not only learned new technologies such as Java/ J2EE/ HTML 5/ JQuery/ Oracle very quickly but also used these technologies efficiently in the live complex project. And within a short span of time, he started working as an experience professional whom you can trust blindly. He handled number of complex modules independently in his first year at HCL. It is really great to work with him. Way to go Vasu.
